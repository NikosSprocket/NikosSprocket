- Hi, I’m @NikosSprocket
- I’m interested in Rapid Manufacturing/Prototyping and mostly FDM (3D Printing)
- I’m currently building, customizing and tuning for speed but without compromising print quality.
- I’m looking to collaborate and share my ideas and modifications with engineers/makers.
- I started my FDM journey with a PRUSA MK3S+ and at this moment I am tuning my 2nd VORON 2.4r2 using the awesome VORON/Klipper and other communities!
- Most of the objects I create and/or modify are developed on AutoDESK Fusion 360.
- I use SuperSlicer and PrusaSlicer for preparing the objects to be printed.
- ASA, ABS, PLA and PET are filaments I use.
